_**User**_

the beer count isnt counting up, and the blur is no longer there.

_**Assistant**_

I apologize, but I don't have access to your current code context to see the beer counter implementation or blur effect you're referring to. To help debug this issue, I would need to see:

1. The component where the beer counter is implemented
2. The code handling the blur effect
3. Any relevant state management code

I recommend trying agent mode, which can look through your codebase to find the relevant code and help identify why the counter isn't incrementing and why the blur effect disappeared.

To use agent mode, simply select it from the input box when asking your question. The agent will be able to:
1. Locate the relevant code files
2. Analyze the counter logic
3. Check the blur effect implementation
4. Suggest specific fixes for both issues
