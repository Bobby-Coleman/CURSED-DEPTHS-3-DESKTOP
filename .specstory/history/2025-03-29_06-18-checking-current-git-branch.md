# Checking Current Git Branch (2025-03-29 02:18:28)

_**User**_

what branch are we on github

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you check which Git branch you're currently on.


---

```bash
git branch --show-current | cat
```

```
Admin@MacBook-2 CURSED DEPTHS 3 % git branch --show-current | cat
gh-pages
Admin@MacBook-2 CURSED DEPTHS 3 %
```

---

You are currently on the `gh-pages` branch. This branch is typically used for hosting GitHub Pages websites, which suggests this project might have a web component that's being hosted through GitHub Pages.

---

_**User**_

shwo all branches

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll show you all branches in the repository, including both local and remote branches.


---

```bash
git branch -a | cat
```

```
Admin@MacBook-2 CURSED DEPTHS 3 % git branch -a | cat
  desktop_main
* gh-pages
  main
  old_version
  temp_old_version
  remotes/desktop/gh-pages
  remotes/desktop/main
Admin@MacBook-2 CURSED DEPTHS 3 %
```

---

Here are all the branches in your repository:

Local branches:
- `gh-pages` (currently checked out, marked with *)
- `desktop_main`
- `main`
- `old_version`
- `temp_old_version`

Remote branches (from the 'desktop' remote):
- `desktop/gh-pages`
- `desktop/main`

The asterisk (*) indicates that you're currently on the `gh-pages` branch.

---

_**User**_

checkout temp old version

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you switch to the `temp_old_version` branch.



---

```bash
git checkout temp_old_version | cat
```

```
Admin@MacBook-2 CURSED DEPTHS 3 % git checkout temp_old_version | cat
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
        .specstory/history/2025-03-29_04-10-beer-collection-system-issues.md
        index.html
        player.js
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.

It looks like you have some uncommitted changes in your current branch that would be overwritten if you switch branches. The changes are in these files:
- `.specstory/history/2025-03-29_04-10-beer-collection-system-issues.md`
- `index.html`
- `player.js`

You have two options:
1. Commit your current changes before switching branches
2. Stash your changes temporarily

Would you like me to help you with either of these options?

---

_**User**_

stash

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you stash your current changes so you can switch branches.


---

```bash
git stash | cat
```

```
Admin@MacBook-2 CURSED DEPTHS 3 % git stash | cat
Saved working directory and index state WIP on gh-pages: 3240ebe Ensure all changes are committed
Admin@MacBook-2 CURSED DEPTHS 3 %
```

---

Great! Your changes have been successfully stashed. Now let's switch to the `temp_old_version` branch.


---

```bash
git checkout temp_old_version | cat
```

```
Admin@MacBook-2 CURSED DEPTHS 3 % git checkout temp_old_version | cat
Switched to branch 'temp_old_version'
Admin@MacBook-2 CURSED DEPTHS 3 %
```

---

Perfect! You are now on the `temp_old_version` branch. Your previous changes are safely stored in the stash. If you want to retrieve these changes later, you can use `git stash pop` or `git stash apply`. Would you like me to help you with anything else?

---

_**User**_

yeah run a server for this on 6060

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you start a local server on port 6060. Since this appears to be a web project, I'll use Python's built-in HTTP server which is simple and effective for local development.


---

```bash
python3 -m http.server 6060
```

---

The server is now running! You can access your website by opening a web browser and navigating to:
```
http://localhost:6060
```

The server will continue running in the background. When you want to stop it, you can press Ctrl+C in the terminal or let me know and I can help you stop it.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?
